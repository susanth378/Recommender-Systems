# Introduction

Brief intro about Recommender Systems, so we get to know why do we perform recommendations:

Recommendations are the helpful tips which will help us to decide on things we are going to do. In our daily life we have different people who act as recommenders like sister/ girl friend to show dresses which we would like when we go to shop, professor who provides us a list of useful books on a topic, friends to suggest movies which we would like and so on... as this depends on the network which each individual will possess but we if need to look at unified recommendations there comes the online recommendations systems.

We have different applications of online recommendations where systems offering news articles to online newspaper readers, based on a prediction of reader interest or offering customers of an online retailer suggestions about what they might like to buy, based on their past history of purchases and/or product searches. So to give good suggestions to customers which there are unaware off and simultaneously to get benefits/profits from all the content which they possess online platforms use the application of recommender systems.

## Types of recommendation systems

There are 3 basic commonly used RS:
* Content Based RS
* Collaborative RS
* Hybrid RS

Below are other types briefly described which can be used as per the requirement, but will go deep about above mentioned RS: 
* Demographic based RS : This system aims to categorize the users based on attributes and make recommendations based on demographic classes. The benefit of a demographic approach is that it does not require a history of user ratings like that in collaborative and content based recommender systems.

* Utility based RS : Utility based recommender system makes suggestions based on computation of the utility of each object for the user. Of course, the central problem for this type of system is how to create a utility for individual users. In utility based system, every industry will have a different technique for arriving at a user specific utility function and applying it to the objects under consideration. The main advantage of using a utility based recommender system is that it can factor non-product attributes, such as vendor reliability and product availability, into the utility computation. This makes it possible to check real time inventory of the object and display it to the user.

* Knowledge based RS : This type of recommender system attempts to suggest objects based on inferences about a userâ€™s needs and preferences. Knowledge based recommendation works on functional knowledge: they have knowledge about how a particular item meets a particular user need, and can therefore reason about the relationship between a need and a possible recommendation.

One can find the above types in detail [here](https://www.bluepiit.com/blog/classifying-recommender-systems/#:~:text=There%20are%20majorly%20six%20types,system%20and%20Hybrid%20recommender%20system.).
